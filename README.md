# On The Radar

Have you ever been walking through your campus and wondered what’s happening around you, but too unmotivated to search through Facebook, the school’s website and where ever else people post about social gatherings and just want to see what’s around? Ever see an event online and think this looks like a lot of fun, just to realize that the event has already ended, or is on a different day? Do you usually find yourself looking for nearby events in your neighbourhood while you’re bored? Looking for a better app that could give you notifications, and have all the events in one and accessible place? These are some of the questions that inspired us to build “On the Radar” --- a user-friendly map navigation system that allows users to discover cool, real-time events that suit their interests and passion in the nearby area. 

*Now you’ll be flying over the Radar!
